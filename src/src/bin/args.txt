Things that all executables need to have in order to be moved into
supported-bins/. 
    - must use getopt, and follow standard argument conventions, listed below.
    - must have good error messages for failures
    - must follow include file guidelines
    - must be properly licensed
    - must have proper makefile and static/dynamic executable
    - must follow coding style (indentation, spacing, etc)
    - should work cross platform (must have _very_ good excuse if not.)
    - should allow use against debug memory/cmos dumps (not possible for
      things like SMI, though.)


STANDARD ARGUMENT CONVENTIONS

We need to standardize the arguments across the binaries in this dir such that
the following list is always a common list of cmdline options. default help
text is also listed.

If a program does not use these args, it should never re-use these letters or
long option names for another value. (For example, if an executable doesnt use
--set, it shouldn't use -s for something else.)
